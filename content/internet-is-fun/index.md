# The <span>internet</span> used to be &#x2728;fun&#x2728;

I've been meaning to write some kind of Important Thinkpiece&trade; on the glory days of the early internet, but every time I sit down to do it, I find another, better piece that someone else has already written. So for now, here's a collection of articles that to some degree answer the question “Why have a personal website?” with "Because it's fun, and the internet used to be fun."

If you've written something that feels like it belongs here—especially if your voice is one that's frequently underrepresented—I'd be interested to read it! Holler at me via email (kwon at fastmail.com), or on Mastodon ([mastodon.social/@rjkwon](https://mastodon.social/@rjkwon)).
